    "description": "If you use secure cluster connectivity with the default VNet that Azure Databricks creates, Azure Databricks automatically creates a NAT gateway for outbound traffic from your workspace's subnets to the Azure backbone and public network. The NAT gateway is created within the managed resource group managed by Azure Databricks. You cannot modify this resource group or any resources provisioned within it. This NAT gateway incurs additional cost.",
    "description2": "Secure Cluster Connectivity (NPIP) in Azure Databricks ensures compute resources lack public IP addresses, enhancing security by routing all traffic through a control plane relay via port 443. This feature is automatically enabled for new workspaces created via Azure Portal or ARM templates, but can also be added to existing workspaces using VNet injection. Enabling this involves stopping all compute resources, updating the workspace settings (via Azure Portal, ARM template, or Terraform), and validating the update once the workspace is active. Additional costs may arise due to increased egress traffic, and Microsoft recommends implementing a stable egress public IP for complex routing requirements or VNet injection deployments."

For Time Series and Inference profiles, additional parameters like metric granularities, timestamp columns, prediction columns, and model IDs are required. Advanced options allow setting schedules, email notifications, custom metrics, and slicing expressions for more precise monitoring. Post-creation, monitor results can be refreshed manually, and access to outputs is controlled via Unity Catalog privileges.

    "description2": "This Databricks documentation explains how to optimize stateful processing in Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines using watermarks. Watermarks are a feature of Apache Spark that define a time-based threshold for processing data, crucial for managing state during operations like aggregations, joins, and deduplication. They prevent high latency and Out-of-Memory (OOM) errors by closing the time window when the threshold is reached. To define a watermark, specify a timestamp field and a delay value; records arriving after this threshold might be dropped. Watermarks are essential for stream-stream joins, requiring definitions on both sides with time interval clauses to handle data incompleteness. They also facilitate correct calculation of operations like time-window aggregations. Examples in Python and SQL demonstrate their usage in various scenarios such as joining streams and performing windowed aggregations. The document concludes by recommending enabling RocksDB-based state management for better control over intermediate state, especially for large-scale processing."

The ML Beta version introduced updates to machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow (1.14.0 to 1.15.0), PyTorch (1.2.0 to 1.3.0), MLflow (1.3.0 to 1.4.0), and Hyperopt (0.2-db1 with Azure Databricks MLflow integrations). It also included mleap-databricks-runtime version 0.15.0, which incorporates mleap-xgboost-runtime. The non-ML Beta version brought optimizations for Delta Lake's insert-only merge and improvements/bug fixes. Additionally, Databricks announced the General Availability (GA) of Databricks Container Services for Azure, allowing users to configure clusters with custom container images, although the preview version was available upon request. Other updates included a change in cluster detail display to show only the cluster ID in HTTP paths and the introduction of Public Preview support for referencing secrets in Spark configuration properties or environment variables, starting from Databricks Runtime 6.1."

To simplify these governance tasks, the lakehouse offers a unified governance solution for data, analytics and AI.

Because the operation is an outer join, all records from the store_sales table are preserved, so the join does not change any data from that table. The SUM aggregation is the same whether or not these tables are joined.",
